                        <h2>Definition of Stative Verbs</h2>
                        <p>Stative verbs describe a state, condition, or situation rather than an action or process. They often refer to feelings, thoughts, possession, senses, or relationships.</p>
                        <p>Because they represent states, they are usually not used in continuous (progressive) tenses.</p>

                        <h2>Use Cases and Structure</h2>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Typically used in simple tenses (e.g., present simple, past simple) rather than continuous forms because they describe unchanging states.</li>
                        <li>When used in continuous tenses, the meaning often shifts to describe temporary or changing situations (e.g., "I am loving this song!" as an informal or emphatic usage).</li>
                        <li>In questions and negatives, use the auxiliary verbs do/does/did with the base form of the stative verb in simple tenses (e.g., "Do you know her?" "I do not want to go.").</li>
                        <li>Commonly appear in descriptive or expressive contexts.</li>

                        <h2>Tips for Using Stative Verbs</h2>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Learn common stative verbs and avoid using them in continuous tenses unless you want to emphasize a temporary or unusual state.</li>
                        <li>Pay attention to verb meaning shifts when certain stative verbs (think, have, see) are used in continuous form.</li>
                        <li>In writing and formal contexts, stick to simple tenses with stative verbs for clarity and correctness.</li>
                        <li>In conversational or informal English, some stative verbs in continuous form are acceptable for emphasis or stylistic reasons.</li>
